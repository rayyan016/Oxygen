## APOD Display using React, NASA API and Tailwind CSS

This project is a simple web application that fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) from the NASA API and displays it using React and Tailwind CSS. The goal of this project was to learn how to use hooks in React, specifically useState() and useEffect().

### Technologies Used

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- NASA API


### To use this application, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal
- Start the application by running `npm start` in the terminal
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

### How It Works

This application is built using React components and uses the useState() hook to manage the state of the APOD data. It also uses the useEffect() hook to fetch the APOD data from the NASA API and update the state when the component mounts.
